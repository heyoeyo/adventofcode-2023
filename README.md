Solutions for 2023 [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/)

---

- Using Python3 (version 3.10.12, though 3.6+ probably works fine)
- Trying to avoid external libraries, so no special environments are needed
- All scripts load input data using relative pathing, so they must run from within their respective folders! For example:

```
cd day_02
python solution.py
```
